            <p>If for any reason, you feel you need to exchange a product for wrong size or any other reason, we will assist you with an exchange. Email us for processing your return at online@letsridesafe.com. Returns will not be accepted unless the same has been communicated to us through email after 7 days of the purchase date.</p>
            <p>The requested exchange will only be processed if the products are in new/unused condition and include original product packaging with all the tags. Please note that the original shipping charges (as on actual) are non-refundable. The cost of returning the goods will be borne by the customer.</p>
            <p>*Please note that the operations of courier companies are not in our control and we cannot be held responsible for delays and thus the delays in your trip. However, we assure you that we try to get the order delivered to you at the earliest.</p>
