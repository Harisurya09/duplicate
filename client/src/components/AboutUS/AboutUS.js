                <p><strong>Let's Ride Safe Gears- “Ride with Reliability”</strong></p>
                <p>We are amongst you all! We ride and do not let go a chance when we see an opportunity to go on short tour (But of late, unfortunately, we are compelled to give a few of them a miss!). Let's Ride Safe was infact born when 3 such passionate riders met; each of them came with their own set of diverse riding preferences, experiences and their favourite riding routes and destinations (which we still quarrel upon like babies when we plan our ride together).</p>
                <p>With all the diversities we came with, all of us believed that the Indian market in 2012 did not have quality and practical luggage. Quality luggage was made available in India by most of the international brands but that came at a price, which was not affordable for most of us. Thus, was born Let's Ride Safe with a vision to provide quality, reliable luggage at a price we believed most of us were willing to shell out for our rides. We all ride and thus understand the criticality of an equipment failure during a ride.</p>
                <p>“Quality is not an act. It is a habit”. This is the exact notion that we follow at Let's Ride Safe Gears. As a part of our job, we have made a habit of keeping ourselves updated on raw materials, technology, etc that our Indian and International market has to offer in helping us make a better product for our customers. For us, it has always been quality over price i.e. expand a tad bit to get the right material. This is how we function!</p>
                <p>For almost a year we only concentrated on manufacturing reliable, practical and no-nonsense luggage solutions. It was only after one successful year of manufacturing luggage that we slowly moved towards designing motorcycle apparels.</p>
                <p>Protection, Comfort, Reliability and Style has been the pillars of our motorcycle apparels. At Let's Ride Safe we do not believe in rushing through the process to launch a new product. Thus when we release a product you can be sure that it has gone through some rigorous bashing on different terrains by our testers, who are veteran riders with some incredible mileage on their side.</p>
                <p>With this, we welcome you to Let's Ride Safe- <strong>“Ride With Reliability”</strong> <br/><strong>Ride More. Ride Safe!</strong></p>

                <h2>Technology and Material</h2>
                <p><strong>WHAT’s BEHIND OUR BUILD QUALITY!!</strong></p>
                <p>Motorcycle Luggage and Apparels are subjected to an array of adversities that mother nature and mankind have to offer. Having said that, using the right material at the right place for the right occasion is what separates the best from the rest! “Quality is not an act. It is a habit”. This is the exact notion that we follow at Let's Ride Safe Gears. As a part of our job, we have made a habit of keeping ourselves updated on raw materials, technology, etc that our Indian and International market has to offer in helping us make a better product for our customers.</p>
                <p>Following is a list of materials and technology we are currently employing to give the customer exactly what he/she is looking for. As we make breakthroughs, we assure you that the list will keep on increasing!Following is a list of materials and technology we are currently employing to give the customer exactly what he/she is looking for. As we make breakthroughs, we assure you that the list will keep on increasing!</p>
                <h4>Technology:</h4>
                <p>We use the best machinery of Japanese and German origins to ensure efficient production output. Every product is conscientiously handcrafted with a painstaking eye for detail. The process requires the skilled labour of the artisan kind and we ensure that each product that passes through our stringent QC checks has quality in every stitch and seam.</p>
                <h4>Fabric:</h4>
                <p>We use fabric ranging from 1000x1000 Denier (1000D) to 1680x1680 Denier (1680D). Industrial grade EVA is used for laminating the fabric to ensure durability and strength.</p>
                <p>Note: Don’t be misled on “Denier Stories”. Denier refers to the weight of a fabric, not its strength. So a 2000D material may not necessarily be stronger than a 1000D or 1680D material. A 2000D fabric if not knitted properly may give away on your first ride itself!</p>
                <h4>Micro-Velcro:</h4>
                <p>Micro-Velcro is a micro-mechanical fastening system based on micro-machining.  It is an upgraded and contemporary Velcro material which counters the drawbacks of the Old School Velcro which scratches, itches or hurts the user.</p>
                <h4>Knox:</h4>

We use original YKK Pullers and Sliders where required. We also have a tie-up with a German Waterproof Zip manufacturer who provides the best-in-class waterproof zippers that the International market has to offer.</p>
                <h4>Webbing :</h4>
                <p>We use high- tensile strength webbing in our apparels and bags.</p>
                <h4>CE Approved Armors:</h4>
                <p><img src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1947/9551/files/ce-mark_small.jpg' alt="CE Approved Armors" /><br/><br/>All the armors provided in the jackets are CE EN 1621-1 approved. Every batch is tested as per the CE Standards whilst generating a test report.</p>

                <h4>Rare-earth Magnets:</h4>
                <p>We use Monopole Rare-earth Magnets in our tank bags. Traditional run-of-the-mill Neodymium magnets (no matter how strong they are) are temperature sensitive and highly corrosive. They lose their strength and corrode rapidly when exposed to water/moisture thus causing scratches on the tank.</p>
                <p>We care for the Tank of your motorcycle as much as you do! Which is why we took the extra effort of providing you exactly what you need! The base material on the Tankbag ensures no scratches on the Tank and the high pull of the magnets makes sure that the Tankbag is secure on matter how stuffed it is.</p>
                <p>“Monopole” ensures singular polarity. This means that the other side of the magnet will virtually have Zero polarity. You can put your electronic devices inside the Tankbag without having to worry about the magnetic field that may affect them.</p>
                <h4>Reissa :</h4>
                <p>Reissa is a three-layer microporous membrane with a PU (polyurethane) coating and different-sized pores. Reissa ® is waterproof, windproof, breathable and is used as an Inner Liner inside the jacket.</p>
                <h4>Schoeller Keprotec Fabric:</h4>
                <p>A product of Schoeller Switzerland, the fabric is five times stronger than steel per gram and used in the manufacture to provide Frictional Resistance, Heat Resistance, and Weather resistance</p>
